# WhatTheFood 📸🥗

**WhatTheFood** is an AI-powered mobile application that transforms physical restaurant menus into interactive, digital experiences. By simply taking a photo, the app helps diners make informed food choices by revealing hidden details about their meal.

### 🚀 What it Does
WhatTheFood uses advanced Artificial Intelligence (OpenAI GPT-4o & DALL-E 3) to "read" menu images. It doesn't just extract text—it understands food. It automatically detects dietary types (Vegan/Veg/Non-Veg), flags potential allergens, infers ingredients, and even generates photorealistic images of dishes so you can see what you're ordering before it arrives.

### 🗺️ User Journey
1.  **Snap:** The user opens the app and takes a picture of a menu (or picks one from the gallery).
2.  **Process:** The image is sent to the secure cloud backend where AI extracts dish names and descriptions.
3.  **Enrich:** The app analyzes each item to tag allergens, ingredients, and dietary preferences.
4.  **Visualize:** Users browse the digitized menu with clear safety tags and AI-generated food photos to decide what to eat with confidence.

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/nest?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your remote caching setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/MYrgQDA5aI)


## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve api
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build api
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project api
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/nest:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
